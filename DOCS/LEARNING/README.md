# Learning Materials

This directory contains educational documentation generated through **Learning Mode** in Claude Code.

## Purpose

Learning materials help you understand the technical concepts, architectural decisions, and implementation patterns used in this project through:

- Analogies and storytelling that make complex ideas digestible
- Annotated code examples showing concepts in action
- Visual diagrams illustrating how components connect
- Reflection questions to deepen understanding
- Practical exercises to reinforce learning

## How to Generate Learning Materials

1. Activate Learning Mode:
   ```
   /learning-mode
   ```

2. Work on your feature, bug fix, or improvement as you normally would

3. Learning materials will be automatically generated and saved here

4. Review the materials and ask any questions you have about the concepts

## File Naming Convention

All learning documents follow this pattern:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-{topic-slug}.md
```

**Examples**:
- `2025-10-17-grpc-streaming-implementation.md`
- `2025-10-18-database-connection-pooling.md`
- `2025-10-19-server-actions-pattern.md`

## Document Structure

Each learning document includes:

1. **What We Built** - Overview of the implementation
2. **Core Concepts Explained** - Technical ideas explained through analogies
3. **How It All Connects** - System-level view showing relationships
4. **Key Takeaways** - Main lessons learned
5. **Try It Yourself** - Hands-on challenges
6. **Further Reading** - Resources for deeper learning
7. **Questions for Reflection** - Thought-provoking prompts

## Topics Covered

<!-- This section will be automatically updated as new materials are added -->

## Tips for Using Learning Materials

- **Read actively**: Try to answer reflection questions before looking up solutions
- **Ask questions**: If a concept isn't clear, ask Claude Code for clarification
- **Build on knowledge**: Each document assumes you've read related materials
- **Practice**: Use the "Try It Yourself" sections to reinforce learning
- **Connect ideas**: Look for patterns across different learning documents

## Contributing

Learning materials are automatically generated, but you can:

- Request clarification on specific concepts
- Ask for additional examples
- Suggest topics for future learning materials
- Share feedback on what explanations work best for you

**Remember**: The goal is understanding, not memorization. Take your time with each concept and don't hesitate to ask questions!
